THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO HAVE A LOCAL COMMUNITY WORKING ON
A PROJECT THAT WILL SOLELY BE AWESOME

WHO CAN COMMIT, ANYONE AS LONG AS THEY ARE AWARE OF THE PROJECT 
AND ITS GOAL

BRANCHING IS ENCOURAGED, AND IS ALMOST MANDAATORY FOR A PROJECT 
LIKE THIS

REMEMBER, TRY TO COMMIT, THIS IS A COMUNITY PROJECT. AND FEEL FREE
TO ASK AROUND.

HAVE FUN,
